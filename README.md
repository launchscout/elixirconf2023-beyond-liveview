## ElixirConf 2022

This is the deck for my ElixirConf talk. I've checked in both the markdown source and the 
html output. This was probably a little silly, as the html is generated and shouldn't be edited directly. I use marp to generate the HTML.

## Usage

```
npm install
```

## Building the HTML

```
npm run build
```
